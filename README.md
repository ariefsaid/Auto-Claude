### Ideation

Let AI help you create a project that shines. Rapidly understand your codebase and discover:
- Code improvements and refactoring opportunities
- Performance bottlenecks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Documentation gaps
- UI/UX enhancements
- Overall code quality issues

### Changelog

Write professional changelogs effortlessly. Generate release notes from completed Auto Claude tasks or integrate with GitHub to create masterclass changelogs automatically.

### Context

See exactly what Auto Claude understands about your project — the tech stack, file structure, patterns, and insights it uses to write better code.

### AI Merge Resolution

When your main branch evolves while a build is in progress, Auto Claude automatically resolves merge conflicts using AI — no manual `<<<<<<< HEAD` fixing required.

**How it works:**
1. **Git Auto-Merge First** — Simple non-conflicting changes merge instantly without AI
2. **Conflict-Only AI** — For actual conflicts, AI receives only the specific conflict regions (not entire files), achieving ~98% prompt reduction
3. **Parallel Processing** — Multiple conflicting files resolve simultaneously for faster merges
4. **Syntax Validation** — Every merge is validated before being applied

**The result:** A build that was 50+ commits behind main merges in seconds instead of requiring manual conflict resolution.

### Multi-Provider Support

Auto Claude gives you flexibility in choosing your AI provider. Use Claude Code (recommended default) or switch to OpenCode for access to 20+ LLM providers.

| Provider | Description | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Claude Code** | Official Claude Code SDK with OAuth | Most users (recommended) |
| **OpenCode** | Multi-provider CLI (20+ LLMs) | Cost optimization, specific model preferences |

**Supported OpenCode Providers:**
- **OpenAI** — GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, o1, o1-mini
- **Google Gemini** — Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash
- **Groq** — Ultra-fast Llama 3.1 inference
- **Together AI, Mistral, Fireworks** — Open-source models
- **Ollama** — Run models locally (free, private)
- **Custom providers** — Any OpenAI-compatible API

**Configure via UI:**
1. Open Project Settings → Provider tab
2. Select your agent provider (Claude Code or OpenCode)
3. If OpenCode: choose your LLM provider and configure credentials
4. Save settings

**Configure via CLI:**
```bash
# Override provider for a single run
python auto-claude/run.py --spec 001 --provider opencode
```

## CLI Usage (Terminal-Only)

For terminal-based workflows, headless servers, or CI/CD integration, see **[guides/CLI-USAGE.md](guides/CLI-USAGE.md)**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Auto Claude focuses on three core principles: **context engineering** (understanding your codebase before writing code), **good coding standards** (following best practices and patterns), and **validation logic** (ensuring code works before you see it).

### The Agent Pipeline

**Phase 1: Spec Creation** (3-8 phases based on complexity)

Before any code is written, agents gather context and create a detailed specification:

1. **Discovery** — Analyzes your project structure and tech stack
2. **Requirements** — Gathers what you want to build through interactive conversation
3. **Research** — Validates external integrations against real documentation
4. **Context Discovery** — Finds relevant files in your codebase
5. **Spec Writer** — Creates a comprehensive specification document
6. **Spec Critic** — Self-critiques using extended thinking to find issues early
7. **Planner** — Breaks work into subtasks with dependencies
8. **Validation** — Ensures all outputs are valid before proceeding

**Phase 2: Implementation**

With a validated spec, coding agents execute the plan:

1. **Planner Agent** — Creates subtask-based implementation plan
2. **Coder Agent** — Implements subtasks one-by-one with verification
3. **QA Reviewer** — Validates all acceptance criteria
4. **QA Fixer** — Fixes issues in a self-healing loop (up to 50 iterations)

Each session runs with a fresh context window. Progress is tracked via `implementation_plan.json` and Git commits.

**Phase 3: Merge**

When you're ready to merge, AI handles any conflicts that arose while you were working:

1. **Conflict Detection** — Identifies files modified in both main and the build
2. **3-Tier Resolution** — Git auto-merge → Conflict-only AI → Full-file AI (fallback)
3. **Parallel Merge** — Multiple files resolve simultaneously
4. **Staged for Review** — Changes are staged but not committed, so you can review before finalizing

### 🔒 Security Model

Three-layer defense keeps your code safe:
- **OS Sandbox** — Bash commands run in isolation
- **Filesystem Restrictions** — Operations limited to project directory
- **Command Allowlist** — Only approved commands based on your project's stack

## Project Structure

```
your-project/
├── .worktrees/               # Created during build (git-ignored)
│   └── auto-claude/          # Isolated workspace for AI coding

```

### Understanding the Folders

**You don't create these folders manually** - they serve different purposes:

- **`auto-claude/`** - The framework repository itself (clone this once from GitHub)
- **`.auto-claude/`** - Created automatically in YOUR project when you run Auto Claude (stores specs, plans, QA reports)
- **`.worktrees/`** - Temporary isolated workspaces created during builds (git-ignored, deleted after merge)

**When using Auto Claude on your project:**
```bash
cd your-project/              # Your own project directory
python /path/to/auto-claude/run.py --spec 001
# Auto Claude creates .auto-claude/ automatically in your-project/
```

**When developing Auto Claude itself:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auto-claude
cd auto-claude/               # You're working in the framework repo
```

The `.auto-claude/` directory is gitignored and project-specific - you'll have one per project you use Auto Claude on.

## Environment Variables (CLI Only)

> **Desktop UI users:** These are configured through the app settings — no manual setup needed.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | Yes | OAuth token from `claude setup-token` |
| `AUTO_BUILD_MODEL` | No | Model override (default: claude-opus-4-5-20251101) |
